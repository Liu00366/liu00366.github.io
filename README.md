# description

This is an unfinished portfolio. I did not complete any subpage in the portfolio because I haven't decided which one to show yet. ONLY when it's already online project, the button will take you there. I will make my profoilo ready by next four months holiday.

## learned
By creating the portfolio, I use the skills I've learned, such as CSS Framework, Animation, and Bootstrap.

## challenges
The biggest challenges I faced was the manage of borders, paddings, and margins. Sometimes I'm confused about the rules between them. I overcame those changes by used the inspact tool which is a build in debugging tool in most browser.
