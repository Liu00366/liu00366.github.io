                <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    I am studing <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> in <b>Algonquin Collage</b> right now. I studied Graphic design in China. And finished the Computer Programmer course in <b>Algonquin Collage</b> last year. After a year on the job, I realized I didn't like programming.
                    So I choose to come to our major. Hopefully I can be a UX designer in the future.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Painting</li>
                I like to draw when I am in a bad mood. Drawing helps me calm down and focus my attention on my drawing.
                <li>planting</li>
                I like to grow succulent plants. I have planted more than one hundred POTS in my indoor garden. I like their varied colors, and chubby.
